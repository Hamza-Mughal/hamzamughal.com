  <h1 class="paragraph-header">How Did I End Up In Computer Science?</h1>
  <div class="paragraph-body">
      <h3>This is actually an interesting story, so buckle up.... When I started my time at
          GMU, I had no idea  what I wanted to even do after High School (as many other prospective students do). During the summer
          after High School had ended, I decided to take a free Python course where I had learned some very basic operations. Mind you,
          majoring in Computer Science did not cross my mind at this moment. Fast foward a year into my Undergraduate: I was still undeclared,
          and had to choose a major to begin making actual progress. My friend, Nabil Darwich, was majoring in Computer Science at the time,
          and he would tell me about what he would be doing in his CS classes occasionally. Hearing about what he was learning excited me.
          Me taking the python course over the summer a year earlier and Nabil's talks with me pushed me to pursue Computer Science as my career choice.

  <h1 class="paragraph-header">My Time As An Undergrad</h1>
  <div class="paragraph-body">
      <h3>I enjoyed my time as an undergraduate primarily because of some of the professors. I've had the great pleasure
      of taking courses under excellent professors such as Dr. Mark Snyder and Dr. Jonathan Bell.
      Additionally, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for the CS department for three semesters. I assisted with
      CS 105 and CS 367. I immensely enjoyed working as a UTA as it allowed to me work with students to share my passion for Computer Science with them.
