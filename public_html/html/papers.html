  Being able to save human life is one of the most important goals facing various communities. An unfortunately common reality in which lives are lost is due to car accidents, and there are always public service announcements to advise on avoiding them. In this paper, an analysis is conducted regarding the true factors that lead to injuries and fatalities when it comes to car crashes. Data from the City of Chicago, during the summer of 2018, is used to find out what some of these causes are, and a model is built to determine accident severity outcomes given the elements involved. The summer season was picked to minimize external factors such as snow and road conditions leading to crashes, and the most recent summer was that of the current year, 2018. We use this data to build a training model, and evaluate how it performs against a never seen before test set (Summer 2017) A goal from this paper is to raise awareness regarding what can be done to avoid such tragedies.

Web server deployments have exponentially grown in the 21st century with the introduction of cloud server providers such as Amazon. Web servers have been increasingly becoming more and more important to the profitability of companies. To put it into perspective Amazons AWS currently hosts 4.7% of all websites (currently there are approximately 1.8 billion hostnames and 178 million websites).
With web servers being readily available for low cost amongst multiple cloud service providers such as Amazon, Cloudhost, Vultr etc., the necessity of a performant web server is also needed to keep up with an increased customer population to a webpage.
This paper analyzes a web servers ability to keep up with increased concurrent demand as files are requested and subsequently served to multiple users at the same time
